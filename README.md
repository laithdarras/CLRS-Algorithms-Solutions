# CLRS-Algorithms-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises and problems from the Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition) by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS). The purpose of this project is to track my progress in understanding and implementing the algorithms presented in the textbook, while also practicing problem-solving and refining my skills in algorithm design and analysis.

## Structure
- **Exercises:** Solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises.
- **Problems:** Detailed problem solutions from each chapter.
- **Notes:** Additional explanations, observations, and optimizations for select problems.

## Why this project?
As part of my academic and personal study, this project helps me solidify key concepts in algorithm design and analysis, ensuring that I not only complete the exercises but also thoroughly understand the principles behind them.

Feel free to explore the solutions and contribute any feedback!
